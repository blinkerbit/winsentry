## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Windows 10/11** (required for Windows service management)
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Administrator privileges** (for service management operations)

### Install from PyPI
```bash
pip install winsentry
```

### Install from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/winsentry.git
cd winsentry
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

#### Option 1: Using the installed command (after pip install)
```bash
# Start WinSentry (requires administrator privileges)
winsentry

# Start with custom port
winsentry --port=9999

# Start in debug mode
winsentry --debug
```

#### Option 2: Running directly from source
```bash
# Run the entry point script
python run_winsentry.py

# Or use the Windows batch file
run_winsentry.bat

# With custom options
python run_winsentry.py --port=9999 --debug
```

#### Option 3: Run as Python module
```bash
# Run the package as a module
python -m winsentry

# With custom options
python -m winsentry --port=9999 --debug
```

#### Option 4: Run main.py directly
```bash
# Run main.py directly (now works with import fallback)
python winsentry\main.py

# With custom options
python winsentry\main.py --port=9999 --debug
```

#### Option 5: Test imports first
```bash
# Test that all modules can be imported
python test_imports.py
```

### Web Interface
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8888`
2. Navigate between tabs:
   - **Services**: Manage Windows services
   - **Port Monitor**: Configure port monitoring and thresholds
   - **Service Monitor**: Configure monitoring of service state; manage monitored services
   - **Resource Monitor**: Configure CPU/RAM thresholds for services; view summaries and current status
   - **Logs**: View monitoring logs

### Service Management
- View all Windows services with their current status
- Start, stop, or restart services with one click
- Real-time status updates
 - Add services to continuous monitoring with custom intervals and optional PowerShell recovery
 - See per-service processes with CPU/RAM and command line; open details modal

### Port Monitoring Setup
1. Go to the **Port Monitor** tab
2. Add ports to monitor with:
   - **Port number** (1-65535)
   - **Check interval** (5-3600 seconds)
   - **PowerShell recovery script** (optional)
3. Monitor real-time status and failure counts
4. View processes bound to a port (CPU%, RAM%, username, cmdline)
5. Configure CPU/RAM thresholds and enable email alerts

### PowerShell Recovery Scripts
Create custom PowerShell scripts for automated recovery:

```powershell
# Example: restart-service.ps1
param([int]$Port)

# Restart a specific service when port goes offline
Restart-Service -Name "YourServiceName" -Force
Write-Host "Service restarted for port $Port"
```

## Configuration

### Command Line Options
```bash
winsentry --help
```

Available options:
- `--port`: Web server port (default: 8888)
- `--debug`: Enable debug mode
- `--help`: Show help message

### PowerShell Script Requirements
- Scripts must be `.ps1` files
- Use `param([int]$Port)` to receive port number
- Scripts run with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`
- Maximum execution time: 30 seconds
- Logs are captured and displayed in the UI

### Email Alerts
- Configure SMTP and templates via the Email Config UI
- Enable alerts per service/port threshold configuration
- Built-in templates include service state changes and resource threshold exceedances

## Examples

### Basic Port Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor port 8080 every 30 seconds
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/ports \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"port": 8080, "interval": 30}'
```

# Monitor port 3306 with MySQL restart script
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/ports \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "port": 3306,
    "interval": 60,
    "powershell_script": "C:\\scripts\\restart-mysql.ps1"
  }'
```

### Service Management
```bash
# Start a Windows service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/services/MyService/start

# Stop a Windows service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/services/MyService/stop
```

## Logging

WinSentry creates detailed logs in the `logs/` directory:
- `winsentry.log`: General application logs
- `port_monitor.log`: Port monitoring events
- `service_manager.log`: Service management operations
- `service_monitor.log`: Service monitor and threshold events
- `process_logs` (SQLite): Historical process CPU/RAM metrics (ports & services)

Log files are automatically rotated when they reach 10MB (5MB for specialized logs).

## Security Considerations

- **Run as Administrator**: Required for service management
- **PowerShell Execution**: Scripts run with bypassed execution policy
- **Network Access**: Web interface accessible on all interfaces
- **File Permissions**: Ensure script files have appropriate permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Access Denied" errors:**
- Run WinSentry as Administrator
- Check service permissions

**PowerShell scripts not executing:**
- Verify script file exists and is accessible
- Check PowerShell execution policy
- Review logs for error messages

**Port monitoring not working:**
- Ensure ports are not already in use
- Check firewall settings
- Verify monitoring intervals are reasonable

### Debug Mode
```bash
winsentry --debug
```
Enables detailed logging and error reporting.
